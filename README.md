# NoteWorthy

### Getting started

To create a note, click on the plus icon or simply start typing in the text box. You can give it a title on the left.

If you want to save your notes, click on the save icon. This will store your notes in a remote database for future use. Your notes will also be autosaved every two minutes.

Alternatively, you can delete a note using the trash icon. Make sure you really want to delete it before you hit this button - once it's gone, it's deleted both locally and remotely.
